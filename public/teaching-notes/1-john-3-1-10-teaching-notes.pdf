TEACHING NOTES: 1 JOHN 3:1-10
"A Love Letter from a Pastor" Series

I. MAIN PASSAGE: 1 John 3:1-10 (NET)

[1Jo 3:1-10 NET] 1 (See what sort of love the Father has given to us: that we should be called God's children - and indeed we are! For this reason the world does not know us: because it did not know him. 2 Dear friends, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed. We know that whenever it is revealed we will be like him, because we will see him just as he is. 3 And everyone who has this hope focused on him purifies himself, just as Jesus is pure). 4 Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; indeed, sin is lawlessness. 5 And you know that Jesus was revealed to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. 6 Everyone who resides in him does not sin; everyone who sins has neither seen him nor known him. 7 Little children, let no one deceive you: The one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as Jesus is righteous. 8 The one who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was revealed: to destroy the works of the devil. 9 Everyone who has been fathered by God does not practice sin, because God's seed resides in him, and thus he is not able to sin, because he has been fathered by God. 10 By this the children of God and the children of the devil are revealed: Everyone who does not practice righteousness - the one who does not love his fellow Christian - is not of God.

II. JESUS CAME TO REVEAL

A. First and Foremost: He is the Deliverer
[1Jo 3:5 NET] 5 And you know that Jesus was revealed to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.

B. Three Key Revelations:
1. Our Position – Beloved children of God
2. Our Purpose – Living in holy purity
3. Our Promise – Future glory reflecting Christ fully

Remember: Position. Purpose. Promise. In Christ, the Father's extravagant love is clearly revealed—our identity reclaimed, our calling clarified, and our hope secured.

III. HISTORICAL CONTEXT: THE DISINHERITANCE AND RESTORATION

A. Humanity's Disinheritance at Babel
[Deu 32:8-9 NET] 8 When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when he divided up humankind, he set the boundaries of the peoples, according to the number of the heavenly assembly. 9 For the LORD's allotment is his people, Jacob is his special possession.

• Humanity was disinherited at Babel (Deut. 32:8–9)
• God divided the nations and gave them over to lesser spiritual beings due to their rebellion (cf. Gen. 11)
• Israel became God's covenant people, but the rest of the nations were placed under the rule of other elohim who later became corrupt (Psalm 82)

B. The Corrupt Rule of Lesser Beings
[Psa 82:1-8 NET] 1 God stands in the assembly of El; in the midst of the gods he renders judgment. 2 He says, "How long will you make unjust legal decisions and show favoritism to the wicked? (Selah) 3 Defend the cause of the poor and the fatherless! Vindicate the oppressed and suffering! 4 Rescue the poor and needy! Deliver them from the power of the wicked! 5 They neither know nor understand. They stumble around in the dark, while all the foundations of the earth crumble. 6 I thought, 'You are gods; all of you are sons of the Most High.' 7 Yet you will die like mortals; you will fall like all the other rulers." 8 Rise up, O God, and execute judgment on the earth! For you own all the nations.

C. Jesus' Mission to Reclaim the Nations
• Jesus, the true Son of God and the seed of Abraham, came to reclaim the disinherited nations through His death, resurrection, and the outpouring of the Spirit (Acts 2)

D. Pentecost: The Reversal of Babel
[Act 2:5-11 NET] 5 Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven residing in Jerusalem. 6 When this sound occurred, a crowd gathered and was in confusion, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. 7 Completely baffled, they said, "Aren't all these who are speaking Galileans? 8 And how is it that each one of us hears them in our own native language? 9 Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and the province of Asia, 10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, 11 both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs - we hear them speaking in our own languages about the great deeds God has done!"

Pentecost, where every nation heard the gospel in their own language, was the symbolic reversal of Babel (Acts 2:5–11).

IV. OUR RESTORATION IN CHRIST

A. Brought Near
Ephesians 2:12–13 (NET): "that you were at that time without the Messiah, alienated from the citizenship of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who used to be far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ."

B. Members of God's Household
Ephesians 2:19 (NET): "So then you are no longer foreigners and noncitizens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of God's household."

C. Adopted as Sons and Daughters
Romans 8:15–17 (NET): "For you did not receive the spirit of slavery leading again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, 'Abba, Father.' The Spirit himself bears witness to our spirit that we are God's children. And if children, then heirs (namely, heirs of God and also fellow heirs with Christ)—if indeed we suffer with him so we may also be glorified with him."

D. Sons of Abraham
Galatians 3:7 (NET): "So then, understand that those who believe are the sons of Abraham."
Galatians 3:29 (NET): "And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham's descendants, heirs according to the promise."

V. JESUS CAME TO RESCUE US FROM SIN AND SATAN (1 John 3:4-8)

[1Jo 3:4-8 NET] 4 Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; indeed, sin is lawlessness. 5 And you know that Jesus was revealed to take away sins, and in him there is no sin. 6 Everyone who resides in him does not sin; everyone who sins has neither seen him nor known him. 7 Little children, let no one deceive you: The one who practices righteousness is righteous, just as Jesus is righteous. 8 The one who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was revealed: to destroy the works of the devil.

A. Jesus Rescued Us From:
1. Sin's Deception – Liberating us from rebellion's lies
2. Satan's Dominion – Stripping away the enemy's illegitimate rule
3. Spiritual Defeat – Empowering us to live victoriously

Remember: Deception. Dominion. Defeat. Christ destroyed the chains, dethroned the enemy, and delivered us to live in freedom.

B. Understanding Sin as Lawlessness (vv. 4–6)
• Sin is rebellion (anomia): a rejection of God's rule
• All sin is essentially rebellion against God's law
• "Lawlessness" in Scripture means living as though God's law doesn't matter – a posture of heart that leads to acts of sin and iniquity
• It is not confined to any one group but describes all human wickedness that flouts God's will

Key Equation: sin = lawlessness = rebellion

• Scholars note that John was likely correcting false teachers who downplayed the seriousness of sin
• By defining sin as anomia, he stresses that to commit sin is to declare open rebellion against God's authority
• This understanding brings clarity and gravity: any practice of sin puts one in a stance of opposition to God

C. Clarifying the Particular Sin of "Lawlessness"
When John defines sin as lawlessness in 1 John 3:4, he's speaking broadly of all sin as rebellion against God. However, by verse 10, he focuses his definition more narrowly on specific evidences of "lawlessness":

1. Not Practicing Righteousness
2. Not Loving One's Brother (or Sister)

These two indicators serve as litmus tests, revealing genuine believers versus those who are "lawless" (children of the devil).

D. Jesus Destroyed Satan's Authority (v. 8)
Greek Insights:
• "Destroy" (lysē): to loose, dismantle, nullify
• "Authority" (exousia): legal right or jurisdiction
• "Power" (dunamis): ability, strength, influence

Key Points:
• At the cross, Jesus legally revoked Satan's authority (Col. 2:14–15)
• Satan no longer has jurisdiction over those in Christ
• However, Satan retains functional power (dunamis)—through deception, agreement, and sin

Quote: "Jesus has taken the authority, but people still give the demonic realm influence by believing lies and living in rebellion against God." — Michael Heiser, The Unseen Realm

• Satan's dominion was based on rebellion; Jesus stripped him of the right to rule
• Christ is now exalted with all authority (Matt. 28:18). We are under His domain

VI. JESUS GIVES US NEW LIFE (1 John 3:9-10)

[1Jo 3:9-10 NET] 9 Everyone who has been fathered by God does not practice sin, because God's seed resides in him, and thus he is not able to sin, because he has been fathered by God. 10 By this the children of God and the children of the devil are revealed: Everyone who does not practice righteousness - the one who does not love his fellow Christian - is not of God.

A. New Life Characterized By:
1. A New Heart – Transformed desires and affections
2. A New Heritage – Adopted into the royal family
3. A New Habit – Practicing righteousness consistently

Remember: Heart. Heritage. Habit. Reborn through Christ, we are transformed inwardly, embraced lovingly, and empowered practically.

B. Born of God
• We are born of God—His "seed" (Spirit and nature) lives in us
• This new birth produces a transformation from the inside out
• We cannot remain in sin because our nature has changed—we are a new creation

C. Biblical Foundation for New Birth
Jesus' Teaching to Nicodemus:
John 3:3, 5–6 (NET): "Jesus replied, 'I tell you the solemn truth, unless a person is born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.' ... 'Unless a person is born of water and spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.'"

Old Testament Promise Fulfilled:
Ezekiel 36:26–27 (NET): "I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit within you. I will remove the heart of stone from your body and give you a heart of flesh. I will put my Spirit within you..."

Paul's Description:
2 Corinthians 5:17 (NET): "So then, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; what is old has passed away—look, what is new has come!"

VII. CLOSING EXHORTATION

A. Summary Points:
• Jesus was REVEALED as our Deliverer, restoring us to our identity as God's children
• He RESCUED us by breaking Satan's illegitimate authority, leaving the enemy powerless unless we believe his lies
• We have been REBORN to reflect God's character, live in holiness, and love deeply

B. Simple Takeaway:
You are not who you once were. Satan has no legitimate claim over your life. Today is your day to break agreement with the lies of the enemy.

C. Call to Action:
1. Reflect: What lies have you believed about yourself, about God, about others?
2. Act: Step forward to break agreement with these lies and receive the gift of deliverance and freedom offered today.
